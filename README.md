# GPT-4o Radiologist Assistant Tool

This project demonstrates how GPT-4o can assist radiologists by analyzing MRI images. It is designed to highlight patterns, structures, and potential anomalies in MRI scans, serving as a research tool to support radiologists in their workflow.

## How it works:
The tool uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities to:
- Analyze MRI images in base64-encoded format.
- Provide research-based insights, such as tissue density, unusual structures, or anomalies.
- Serve as a supplementary assistant, NOT for medical diagnosis.

## How to run:
1. Set up an OpenAI API key.
2. Encode your MRI images to base64 format.
3. Use the provided C# script to send the image to the GPT-4o API.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
